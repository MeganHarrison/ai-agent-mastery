#### Module 3: Prototyping with No-Code (n8n)
- Complete n8n workflows for rapid AI agent prototyping
- JSON workflow files ready to import into your n8n instance
- Example configurations for different use cases
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Local AI and "Cloud" AI implementations

#### Module 4: Building & Coding the Agent
- Pydantic AI code examples for structured AI agent development
- Complete Python implementations of agent components
- Configuration scaffolding to use your agents with any LLMs (local and not local)
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation patterns
- Best practices for agent long term memory
- Examples for using your AI agents in a frontend (built with Streamlit)

### How to Use the Course Materials
